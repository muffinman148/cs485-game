## Description of Name
This game is a simple breakout game where the objective is to remove all the rectangle blocks without losing all of your lives. 


## How to Play
Use the arrow keys to move horizontally along the bottom of the play field. "Click" or press the "Control" key to fire your ball.
A rectangle is destroyed by the ball hitting the rectangular block. A life is lost by the ball falling past your paddle. Remove all rectangles before all lives are lost. Good luck!
